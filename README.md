<p align="center">
  <img src="image/Navigation_equation.png" alt="Image of Navigation Equation">
</p>

The transformation of the rotation matrix from the body frame of the F-16 aircraft to the Earth frame can be expressed using roll, pitch, and yaw (Rz Ry Rx).

Where:
- **ẋₑ**: The rate of change of position along the X-axis of the aircraft relative to the Earth frame.
- **ẏₑ**: The rate of change of position along the Y-axis of the aircraft relative to the Earth frame.
- **ż**: The rate of change of position along the Z-axis of the aircraft relative to the Earth frame.

#### 2. Kinematic Equation
<p align="center">
  <img src="image/f16_dynamics.png" alt="Image of f16_dynamics">
  <img src="image/Kinematic_equation.png" alt="Image of Kinematic Equation">
</p>

This equation describes the relationship between angular velocities in the body-fixed frame (P, Q, R) and the rates of change of the Euler angles (ϕ, θ, ψ). **It follows the left-hand rule.**


Where:
- **(ϕ, θ, ψ)**: Roll, Pitch, Yaw (in radians)
- **(P, Q, R)**: Roll, Pitch, Yaw angular rates (in radians per second)


#### 3. Force Equation
<p align="center">
  <img src="image/Force_equation.png" alt="Image of Force equation">
</p>


This equation represents the translational dynamics of a rigid body in a body-fixed coordinate system.

#### 4. Moment Equation
<p align="center">
  <img src="image/Moment_equation.png" alt="Image of Moment Equation">
</p>


This set of equations represents the rotational dynamics of a rigid body in terms of its angular momentum and moments of inertia. These equations are derived from Euler's equations of motion for a rigid body.

where:
- **𝐼ₓₓ**: Moment of inertia around the X-axis (kg·m²)
- **𝐼ᵧᵧ**: Moment of inertia around the Y-axis (kg·m²)
- **𝐼𝓏𝓏**: Moment of inertia around the Z-axis (kg·m²)
- **𝑃, 𝑄, 𝑅**: Roll, Pitch, Yaw angular rates (rad/s)
- **𝐿, 𝑀, 𝑁**: External moments (Nm)
- **Γ**: Moments of inertia in the system (kg²·m⁴)

#### 5. Aerodynamics
<p align="center">
  <img src="image/Aerodynamics.png" alt="Image of Aerodynamics equation">
</p>

This set of equations describes the aerodynamic forces(𝐹ₓ,𝐹ᵧ,𝐹𝓏) and moments(L,M,N) acting on a body, such as an aircraft, in terms of aerodynamic coefficients. These forces and moments depend on several parameters like angle of attack(α), sideslip angle(β), control surface deflections(δₑ,δₐ,δᵣ), and the Mach number.

where:
- **q̄**: Dynamic pressure (Pa)
- **S**: Wing reference area (m²)
- **B**: Wingspan (m)
- **c̄**: Mean aerodynamic chord (m)

#### 6. Force equation new state
<p align="center">
  <img src="image/Force_equation_new_state.png" alt="Image of Force equation new state equation">
</p>

This set of equations appears to describe the translational and angular dynamics of a body in three dimensions.

where:
- **α**: Angle of attack (alpha) (degree)

- **β**: Sideslip angle (beta) (degree)

- **𝐹ₓ**: Force in the x-axis direction

- **𝐹ᵧ**: Force in the y-axis direction

- **𝐹𝓏**: Force in the z-axis direction


#### 7. Linear velocity  
$$
V_T = \sqrt{U^2 + V^2 + W^2}
$$

$$
\alpha = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{W}{U}\right)
$$

$$
\beta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{V}{V_T}\right)
$$

$$
U = V_T \cos\alpha \cos\beta
$$

$$
V = V_T \sin\beta
$$

$$
W = V_T \sin\alpha \cos\beta
$$

This set of equations defines the relationship between the total velocity(𝑉ₜ) of a moving body and its velocity components in a 3D coordinate system. It also introduces two important aerodynamic angles: angle of attack(α), sideslip angle(β). These equations are widely used in flight mechanics and aerodynamics.

#### 8. Dynamic Pressure 
<p align="center">
𝑞̄ = ½ ρ 𝑉ₜ²
</p>


This equation represents dynamic pressure (q), a key parameter in fluid dynamics and aerodynamic.

where:
- ρ is air density,
- 𝑉ₜ is total velocity.

#### 9. Coefficient 
<p align="center">
  <img src="image/Coefficient.png" alt="Image of Coefficient">
</p>

This set of equations defines the aerodynamic coefficients that determine the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on an aircraft or similar body. These coefficients describe how the aerodynamic forces and moments depend on the angles of attack(α), sideslip angle(β), control surface deflections(δₑ,δₐ,δᵣ), and body rates(p,q,r)

where:
- **𝐶ₓ**: Non-dimensional \(x\)-body-axis force coefficient

- **𝐶ᵧ**: Non-dimensional \(y\)-body-axis force coefficient

- **𝐶𝓏**: Non-dimensional \(z\)-body-axis force coefficient

- **𝐶ₗ**: Lift coefficient

- **𝐶ₘ**: Non-dimensional pitching moment coefficient

## Validation 

Our F-16 Simulink model
![alt text](image.png)

This section outlines the stability validation process for the F-16 under specific control surface configurations. The tests assess the aircraft's stability when all control surfaces are neutral.The next section validates the simulation (**Left**: our comparison, **Right**: Validation from Collimator). 


Alpha comparison

Angular_velocity comparison

Linear_velocity comparison

Navigation position comparison
![Image of validate navigation](image/validate_navigation.png)

Orientation comparison
![Image of validate orientation](image/validate_orientation.png)

The comparison data closely matches the validation data, with slight discrepancies in oscillation amplitude during the transient phase. The trends and steady-state behaviors align well, indicating the simulation is reasonably accurate. Further refinements could focus on reducing transient oscillations for closer alignment during dynamic changes.

## Conclusion
This project simulates the motion of an F-16 Fighting Falcon using Unity to model its dynamics and visualize the results graphically. Comparisons with MATLAB may reveal differences depending on the simulation methods and parameters used in each system. 

**Currently, the simulation may lack realism due to incomplete aerodynamic equations.**

Users are encouraged to experiment by adjusting the parameters within the Unity simulation.

## Future Plan
- Enhance the graphical user interface (GUI) and visualization.
- Improve equations to enhance realism.
