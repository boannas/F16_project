## User guide
You can config parameter of F16.
- `Thrust` - For control X axis of airplane.

## Methodology
**Control Surfaces**
![Image of system diagram](image/control_surface.png)
- `Aileron` - Ailerons are a primary flight control surface which control movement about the longitudinal axis of an aircraft. This movement is referred to as "roll".
- `Elevator` - An elevator is a primary flight control surface that controls movement about the lateral axis of an aircraft.This movement is referred to as "pitch".
- `Rudder` -  The rudder is a primary flight control surface which controls rotation about the vertical axis of an aircraft.This movement is referred to as "yaw"
- `Thrust` - Thrust is the force which moves an aircraft through the air. Thrust is generated by the engines of the airplane.

<p align="center">
  <img src="image/Moment_equation.png" alt="Image of Moment Equation">

This set of equations represents the rotational dynamics of a rigid body in terms of its angular momentum and moments of inertia. These equations are derived from Euler's equations of motion for a rigid body.

</p>

This set of equations describes the aerodynamic forces(𝐹ₓ,𝐹ᵧ,𝐹𝓏) and moments(L,M,N) acting on a body, such as an aircraft, in terms of aerodynamic coefficients. These forces and moments depend on several parameters like angle of attack(α), sideslip angle(β), control surface deflections(δₑ,δₐ,δᵣ), and the Mach number.

where:
- **q̄**: Dynamic pressure (Pa)
- **S**: Wing reference area (m²)
- **B**: Wingspan (m)

#### 7. Linear velocity  
$$
V_T = \sqrt{U^2 + V^2 + W^2}

\alpha = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{W}{U}\right)
$$

$$
\beta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{V}{V_T}\right)
$$

$$
U = V_T \cos\alpha \cos\beta
$$

$$
V = V_T \sin\beta
$$

$$
W = V_T \sin\alpha \cos\beta
$$

This set of equations defines the relationship between the total velocity(𝑉ₜ) of a moving body and its velocity components in a 3D coordinate system. It also introduces two important aerodynamic angles: angle of attack(α), sideslip angle(β). These equations are widely used in flight mechanics and aerodynamics.

#### 8. Dynamic Pressure

This set of equations defines the aerodynamic coefficients that determine the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on an aircraft or similar body. These coefficients describe how the aerodynamic forces and moments depend on the angles of attack(α), sideslip angle(β), control surface deflections(δₑ,δₐ,δᵣ), and body rates(p,q,r)

where:
- **𝐶ₓ**: Non-dimensional \(x\)-body-axis force coefficient

## Validation 
This section outlines the stability validation process for the F-16 under specific control surface configurations. The tests assess the aircraft's stability when all control surfaces are neutral and when each orientation is tested independently along each axis.

## 1. Stability with Neutral Control Surfaces
- **Objective**: Verify the aircraft's inherent stability when all control surfaces are set to zero.
- **Test Conditions**:
  - **δₜₕ (Throttle)**: 0.5 (50% thrust for steady flight)
  - **δₐ (Aileron)**: 0°
  - **δₑ (Elevator)**: 0°
  - **δᵣ (Rudder)**: 0°
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - The aircraft should maintain steady, level flight without external disturbances.
  - Minimal oscillations or divergence from the current orientation.

## 2. Stability Test: Orientation Along Each Axis
- **Objective**: Assess the stability response when control inputs are applied along each axis individually.

### 2.1 Roll Stability (Aileron Input)
- **Test Conditions**:
  - **δₜₕ (Throttle)**: 0.5
  - **δₐ (Aileron)**: ±21.5° (maximum deflection, alternating directions)
  - **δₑ (Elevator)**: 0°
  - **δᵣ (Rudder)**: 0°
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - The aircraft should exhibit roll response proportional to the input.
  - Upon returning δₐ to 0°, the aircraft should stabilize and return to level flight.

### 2.2 Pitch Stability (Elevator Input)
- **Test Conditions**:
  - **δₜₕ (Throttle)**: 0.5
  - **δₐ (Aileron)**: 0°
  - **δₑ (Elevator)**: ±30° (maximum deflection, alternating directions)
  - **δᵣ (Rudder)**: 0°
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - The aircraft should pitch up or down based on the elevator input.
  - Upon returning δₑ to 0°, the aircraft should stabilize to a steady state.

### 2.3 Yaw Stability (Rudder Input)
- **Test Conditions**:
  - **δₜₕ (Throttle)**: 0.5
  - **δₐ (Aileron)**: 0°
  - **δₑ (Elevator)**: 0°
  - **δᵣ (Rudder)**: ±25° (maximum deflection, alternating directions)
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - The aircraft should yaw to the right or left based on rudder input.
  - Upon returning δᵣ to 0°, the aircraft should stabilize without significant oscillations.

### 3. Tee lung ka Stability (Integrate 3 orientation axis)
- ** Test Conditions**:
  - **δₜₕ (Throttle)**: 0.5
  - **δₐ (Aileron)**: ±0°
  - **δₑ (Elevator)**: ±0°
  - **δᵣ (Rudder)**: ±0° 
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - The aircraft should "Tee lung ka" when apply Throttle, Aileron, Elevator, Rudder.
  - Upon returning δₐ, δₑ, δᵣ to 0°, the aircraft should stabilize without significant oscillations.

## Conclusion

Summarize why Out doesn't look like validate graph ==== Aerodynamics !!!
